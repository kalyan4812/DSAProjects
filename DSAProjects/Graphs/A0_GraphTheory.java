  /*  ## Graph traversal algorithms.
   * 
   * 1)DFS- same as recursion call./we can use stack for iterative implementation.
   * 2)BFS-Reading layer by layer ,read the neighbour first (FIFO) so we use queue.

  /* ## BFS Applications.
   * 
   * 1)Shortest path kind of problems related to grid/graph.
   * 
   * 2)Cycle detection for both directed(Khans Algo) and undirected.
   * 
   * 3)Prines Algo for MST.
